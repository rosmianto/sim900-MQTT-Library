# Project Update
Hey all! Thank you for your interests on this project. However, I built this super-simple library back in the mid-2016, when there is no other good library for interfacing with SIM900 GSM Module.

Now, we have [TinyGSM Library](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM) which is better in every aspects. Go try it!

I'm deprecating this project, and will keep it as a reference only.

# sim900-MQTT-Library
An arduino library for utilizing MQTT Client using SIM900 GPRS GSM Module
